              Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort
              1–4
              , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined
              5
              , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences
              6,7
              . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’
              8
              —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years
              9
              . Despite recent progress
              10–14
              , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)
              15
              , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

            The systematic and accurate description of protein mutational landscapes is a question of utmost importance in biology, bioengineering, and medicine. Recent progress has been achieved by leveraging on the increasing wealth of genomic data and by modeling intersite dependencies within biological sequences. However, state-of-the-art methods remain time consuming. Here, we present Global Epistatic Model for predicting Mutational Effects (GEMME) (www.lcqb.upmc.fr/GEMME), an original and fast method that predicts mutational outcomes by explicitly modeling the evolutionary history of natural sequences. This allows accounting for all positions in a sequence when estimating the effect of a given mutation. GEMME uses only a few biologically meaningful and interpretable parameters. Assessed against 50 high- and low-throughput mutational experiments, it overall performs similarly or better than existing methods. It accurately predicts the mutational landscapes of a wide range of protein families, including viral ones and, more generally, of much conserved families. Given an input alignment, it generates the full mutational landscape of a protein in a matter of minutes. It is freely available as a package and a webserver at www.lcqb.upmc.fr/GEMME/.},

          Predicting the functional impact of point mutations is a complex yet vital task in genomics. PRESCOTT stands at the forefront of this challenge and reconstructs complete mutational landscapes of proteins, enables the identification of protein regions most vulnerable to mutations and assigns scores to individual mutations, assisting pathologists in evaluating the pathogenic potential of missense variants. PRESCOTT categorizes these variants into three distinct classes: Benign, Pathogenic, or Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS). The model leverages protein sequences across millions of species, advanced protein structural models, and extensive genomic and exomic data from diverse human populations. By using only sequence and structural information, it significantly improves on current standards for predicting mutations in human proteins and matches AlphaMissense performance, which incorporates allele frequency data in its analysis. By including population-specific allele frequencies, PRESCOTT excels in genome-scale score separation of ClinVar benign and pathogenic variants and surpasses AlphaMissense in analyzing the ACMG reference human dataset and the over 1800 proteins from the Human Protein Dataset. Its efficacy is particularly notable in autoinflammatory diseases, accurately predicting pathogenic gain-of-function missense mutations, a task known for its difficulty. Efficiency and accessibility are key aspects of PRESCOTT. The user-friendly PRESCOTT webserver facilitates mutation effect calculations on any protein and protein variants. The server hosts a Comprehensive Human Protein Database for over 19,000 human proteins, based on sequences and structures, ready for a customized allele population analysis. Additionally, the tool provides open access to all intermediate scores, ensuring interpretability and transparency in variant analysis. PRESCOTT is a significant stride forward in the field of genomic medicine, offering unparalleled insights into protein mutational impacts.},

            Learning biological properties from sequence data is a logical step toward generative and predictive artificial intelligence for biology. Here, we propose scaling a deep contextual language model with unsupervised learning to sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. We find that without prior knowledge, information emerges in the learned representations on fundamental properties of proteins such as secondary structure, contacts, and biological activity. We show the learned representations are useful across benchmarks for remote homology detection, prediction of secondary structure, long-range residue–residue contacts, and mutational effect. Unsupervised representation learning enables state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improves state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.
          , 
            In the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

              For a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. We have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern‐recognition process of hydrogen‐bonded and geometrical features extracted from x‐ray coordinates. Cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen‐bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” Repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” Geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. Local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive C
              α
              positions and is positive for right‐handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β‐sheets. Curved pieces are defined as “bends.” Solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. The end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including SS bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. The presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. The dictionary is also available in computer‐readable form for protein structure prediction work.},
